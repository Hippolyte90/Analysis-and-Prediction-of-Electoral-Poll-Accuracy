# Data Sampling and Data Communication
This project aims to analyze electoral polls and their results to evaluate their accuracy and understand the challenges they present, particularly in the context of far-right candidates. It consists of three main parts: a theoretical analysis of polls and their methodologies, a data analysis with visualizations to assess poll accuracy, and an interpretation of the results with recommendations to improve their precision. The expected deliverable includes a concise written report and up to three graphs illustrating the key findings.
